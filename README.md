# CS340 Intro to Databases Town Simulator Project

### Description

This project was worked on with classmate Ryan Pate. This project was focused on front-end database interaction. Ryan and I designed a 3rd Normal Form database for the backbone of the project.
The front-end uses HTML and CSS along with Flask to drive the database interaction.
This project allows a user to easily create a town for something like Dungeons and Dragons. One is able to create Non-Player Characters (NPCs), shops with an inventory of goods and an NPC that runs that shop, and quests that can be assigned to NPCs.
